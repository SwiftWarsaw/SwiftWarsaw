**About the talk**

The arrival of Swift changed the way we think about bending the syntax
while writing for OSX/iOS. Goodbye macros and message-forwarding
proxies, hello operators overloading, tuples and generics. Easier syntax
for subscripting and powerful closures are helping to express the
functionality in the most readable and understandable way. However, with
great power comes great responsibility.

**About the speaker**

Krzysztof is a mobile developer in love with iOS who retains curiosity
for Android. His experiments with Swift syntax were driven by
SwiftMapper - unfinished SwiftCrunch hackathon project. He works at
Touk.
