**About the talk**

Swift is still pretty much work in progress. With some big changes that were
already released to developers, there's still much more to come. Swift In Flux is 
"an attempt to gather the Swift features that are still in flux and likely to change", 
fueled mainly by Apple engineers talking about the language in developer forums.

**About the speaker**

Jan is a self-taught developer and high-school dropout with an unhealthy tech and gadget obsession.

Started working with Objective-C by pure accident and it quickly turned out to be love at first sight - as did Swift.
Works as a iOS developer at Macoscope.


### Swift DSL Toolbelt

- speaker: [Krzysztof Siejkowski](http://siejkowski.net/)
- video: <https://vimeo.com/102847397> (in Polish)
- source: <https://github.com/siejkowski/swift-dsl-toolbelt>

**About the talk**

The arrival of Swift changed the way we think about bending the syntax
while writing for OSX/iOS. Goodbye macros and message-forwarding
proxies, hello operators overloading, tuples and generics. Easier syntax
for subscripting and powerful closures are helping to express the
functionality in the most readable and understandable way. However, with
great power comes great responsibility.

**About the speaker**

Krzysztof is a mobile developer in love with iOS who retains curiosity
for Android. His experiments with Swift syntax were driven by
SwiftMapper - unfinished SwiftCrunch hackathon project. He works at
Touk.
