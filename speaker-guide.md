Speaker Guide
=============

This guide outlines a few important points about Swift Warsaw and talks
that take place during our meetings. It exists so that both speakers
and attendees can enjoy a well organised event.


Code of Conduct
---------------

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Sexual,
racist, or exclusionary language and imagery is not appropriate.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for everyone.


Event Format
------------

At each event there are two or three main talks and an optional
lightning talk session. Talks are held in Polish or English.


### Main Talks

Main talks take up to 15 minutes. There are 3 minutes for questions
after each talk.

It's always awesome when people submit their own talks. If you want to
give one, just shoot as an email at <hello@swiftwarsaw.com> with a short
summary, and we'll contact you sooner than you think.


### Lighting Talks

Lighting Talks are very short presentations. They take up to 5 minutes
and there is no time for questions.

If you want to give a lightning talk, send us an email at
<hello@swiftwarsaw.com>, or talk to us during the event. Spontaneous
lightning talks are always welcome!


Slides
------

Slides are important part of the talk. The following rules make sure
that your slides can be enjoyed even by the people sitting at the back:

- use big fonts
- don't put a lot of text on a slide (code counts as text)
- use high contrast color schemes (white on black works great on the
  projector, [Solarized][] is not readable enough)
- don't get carried away with effects and animations

If you don't have much experience creating technical presentations,
we recommend [Deckset][] — it uses Markdown and has Swift syntax
highlighting.
